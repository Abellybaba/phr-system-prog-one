System Architecture for Personal Health Record (PHR) System
Overview
This document outlines the architecture of the Personal Health Record (PHR) System, designed to store, manage, and facilitate the access of health-related information for patients and healthcare providers.

[Client] --> [Web Server] --> [Application Server] --> [Database Server]
Client: End-users interact with the system through web or mobile clients.
Web Server: Handles HTTP requests and serves the application's user interface.
Application Server: Manages the core logic, user authentication, and interaction with the database.
Database Server: Stores all the system data including user information, health records, etc.
Components

1. Client Layer
   Web Application: Provides access to the system through a browser, allowing users to view, create, update, and delete health records.
   Mobile Application: Offers a mobile interface for the system with similar functionalities as the web application.
2. Web Server
   Nginx/Apache: Acts as the entry point of the system, handling client requests and serving static content.
3. Application Server
   Business Logic: Contains the core functionalities and business rules of the system.
   User Authentication and Authorization: Manages user sessions and permissions, ensuring secure access to data.
   API Layer: Exposes RESTful APIs for the client layer to interact with the application logic and data.
4. Database Server
   Relational Database (SQLite/PostgreSQL): Stores user profiles, health records, authentication data, and other relevant information.
   Schema Design: Organized into tables such as Users, Health Records, Doctors, Patients, etc.
   Security Measures
   Data Encryption: Ensures that sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
   Authentication and Authorization: Implements robust mechanisms to authenticate users and authorize access to various resources.
   Audit Trails: Maintains logs of all system interactions for monitoring and auditing purposes.
   Scalability and Performance
   Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple application server instances to ensure scalability and high availability.
   Caching: Implements caching strategies to reduce database load and improve response times.
   Deployment
   Containerization (Docker): Encapsulates the application and its dependencies into containers for easy deployment and scalability.
   CI/CD Pipeline: Automates the testing and deployment process, ensuring that updates are seamlessly integrated and deployed.
   Monitoring and Logging
   Monitoring Tools (Prometheus/Grafana): Monitors the system's health and performance, providing real-time metrics and alerts.
   Logging: Collects and aggregates logs across the system for troubleshooting and analysis.
